SR-3,NISTControl,SR,Supply Chain Risk Management Controls,"Organizations shall implement comprehensive supply chain risk management processes that identify, assess, select, implement, and monitor security controls to protect organizational systems, information, and services from supply chain-related threats throughout the system development life cycle including design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, and sustainment activities.",24.5
SR-6,NISTControl,SR,Supply Chain Protection - Supplier Assessments,"The organization conducts assessments of supply chain providers to evaluate compliance with security requirements, risk management practices, and organizational policies. Assessments include reviewing supplier security controls, incident response capabilities, and supply chain transparency to ensure adequate protection against compromise throughout the acquisition lifecycle.",22.8
SA-12,NISTControl,SA,Supply Chain Protection,"Organizations employ supply chain protection processes, procedures, and technologies to identify and mitigate risks associated with acquiring systems, components, or services from external suppliers. This includes establishing minimum security requirements for suppliers, conducting security assessments, and implementing monitoring mechanisms to detect potential supply chain compromises during system acquisition and development.",23.7
AC-2,NISTControl,AC,Account Management,"The organization manages information system accounts, including establishing, activating, modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. Organizations establish conditions for group membership, identify authorized users and group membership, and specify access authorizations for each account type. Account management includes monitoring system account usage and generating audit records for anomalous account activity.",19.4
IA-2,NISTControl,IA,Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users),"Information systems uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users or processes acting on behalf of organizational users through cryptographic mechanisms, biometric devices, or multifactor authentication methods. The organization requires authentication of user identity before allowing access to organizational systems and implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms to prevent replay attacks.",20.1
AU-2,NISTControl,AU,Audit Events,"Organizations determine that information systems are capable of auditing security-relevant events defined by organizational policy and coordinated with relevant stakeholders. Auditable events include successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy changes, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. The organization reviews and updates audited events based on current threat information.",18.9
SI-4,NISTControl,SI,System Monitoring,"The organization monitors information systems to detect attacks, indicators of potential attacks, and unauthorized local, network, and remote connections. System monitoring includes intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection mechanisms, scanning for unauthorized network services, and monitoring audit record generation for indications of inappropriate or unusual activity.",17.3
CM-2,NISTControl,CM,Baseline Configuration,"Organizations develop, document, and maintain baseline configurations for information systems that are reviewed and updated at defined frequencies or when required due to system component installations, upgrades, or changes. Baseline configurations represent the current approved state of information systems including hardware, software, firmware, and configuration settings necessary to implement required security controls.",21.6
RA-3,NISTControl,RA,Risk Assessment,"Organizations conduct assessments of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information systems and information they process, store, or transmit. Risk assessments inform security control selection, security requirements determination, and security categorization of systems and information.",19.8
