    "reasoning": "SR-3 establishes comprehensive supply chain risk management processes that directly address T1195 supply chain compromise techniques. Through supplier assessments (SR-6) and acquisition security controls (SA-12), organizations can detect and prevent malicious code injection during software development and distribution phases, mitigating sophisticated attacks like SolarWinds Orion compromise.",
